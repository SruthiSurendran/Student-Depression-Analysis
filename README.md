# 🧠 Student Depression Analysis – SQL & Tableau Project

This project analyzes how various factors such as **sleep duration**, **academic pressure**, **study satisfaction**, **financial stress**, and **study hours** influence the mental health and depression levels of students. By combining SQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard offers interactive insights into patterns that may affect student well-being.

## 📊 Overview

Understanding the root causes of student depression is critical in today’s academic environments. This project focuses on exploring how common academic and lifestyle stressors correlate with the number of students showing depressive symptoms.

The final output is an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore:

- Sleep duration patterns
- Study hour distribution
- Study satisfaction levels
- Academic pressure categories
- Financial stress levels

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL**: For data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation

## 📈 Key Insights

-  **Sleep Duration**: Both less than 5 hours and more than 8 hours showed similar student counts (~123–128), suggesting irregular sleep affects mental health.
-  **Study Hours**: Mid-range study hours (6–10) had higher student counts, indicating a possible balance point between study load and mental well-being.
-  **Academic Pressure**: Level 3 pressure had the highest count (125 students), indicating it as a major stressor.
-  **Study Satisfaction**: Satisfaction Level 4 had the most students (116), suggesting higher satisfaction may be protective.
-  **Financial Stress**: Student counts were spread relatively evenly across levels, pointing to widespread financial pressure.
